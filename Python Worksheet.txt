11. Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.It takes very less time to analyze the source code.
    Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once. 
    In python it first compile and then interpret, therefore we use both of them in python language.
12. PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages. For most installations, you should 
    not set these variables since they are not needed for Python to run.   
13. Python String strip() function will remove leading and trailing whitespaces. If you want to remove only leading or trailing spaces, use lstrip() or rstrip() function instead.
    Example: import re
             s = '  Hello  World   From Pankaj \t\n\r\tHi There  '
             print('Remove all spaces using RegEx:\n', re.sub(r"\s+", "", s), sep='')  
             print('Remove leading and trailing spaces using RegEx:\n', re.sub(r"^\s+|\s+$", "", s), sep='')
